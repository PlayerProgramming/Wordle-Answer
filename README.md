### API I have used
API used : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words/master/sgb-words.txt  
Optimized API: https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=s?a?r  
The reason I didn't use the optimizied api was because I wanted to use text file format to practice my fetch skills.  
The optimizied API would be definitely better for the performance side and for cleaner code though.
